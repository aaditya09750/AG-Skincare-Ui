sm:  640px  /* Small devices (phones) */
md:  768px  /* Medium devices (tablets) */
lg:  1024px /* Large devices (laptops) */
xl:  1280px /* Extra large devices (desktops) */
2xl: 1536px /* Ultra-wide displays */
```

## Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect GitHub repository to Netlify dashboard
2. Configure build settings:
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
   - **Node Version:** 18+
3. Enable automatic deployments from main branch

## Performance Optimizations

**Bundle Optimization** - Tree-shaking, code splitting, and dynamic imports reduce initial bundle size by 40-60%.

**Image Optimization** - WebP format with progressive loading and responsive sizing for optimal performance across devices.

**Caching Strategy** - Aggressive caching of static assets with versioned filenames for optimal browser caching.

**Critical Path** - Above-the-fold content prioritized with resource hints and preloading for faster perceived performance.

## Accessibility Standards

**Semantic Structure** - Proper HTML5 landmarks, heading hierarchy, and ARIA labels for comprehensive screen reader support.

**Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators and logical tab order.

**Color Contrast** - All text meets WCAG AA standards with 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum.

**Interactive Elements** - Touch targets exceed 44px minimum with appropriate spacing for mobile usability.
